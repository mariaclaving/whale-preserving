    <h2>Whales in their natural environment</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Whales, the majestic giants of the oceans, inhabit some of the most diverse and vibrant ecosystems on our planet. These magnificent creatures, ranging from the colossal blue whale to the acrobatic humpback, traverse vast expanses of the world's oceans, from the icy waters of the polar regions to the warm, tropical seas.</p>
        <p>In their natural environment, whales play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem. They are often found in areas with abundant food supply, such as krill, plankton, and small fish. The nutrient-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic are prime feeding grounds for many whale species, particularly during the summer months when the ice retreats and the waters teem with life. In these cold waters, whales can be seen engaging in intricate feeding behaviors, such as bubble-net feeding, where they create spirals of bubbles to corral and capture their prey.</p>

    <h2>Whales in zoos and aqua parks</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Whales are highly intelligent, social creatures that thrive in the vast expanses of the open ocean. In the wild, they travel extensive distances, diving deep and surfacing frequently, engaging in complex social interactions and utilizing their sophisticated communication skills. The physical and mental stimulation provided by their natural environment is essential for their well-being. In contrast, the confines of zoos and aqua parks are drastically inadequate to meet these needs.</p>
        <p>The practice of keeping whales in zoos and aqua parks is fraught with ethical and welfare issues. These intelligent and social animals suffer immensely in captivity, deprived of their natural behaviors, social structures, and environments. True education and conservation should prioritize the protection of whales in the wild, where they can live out their lives in the freedom and richness of their natural habitats.</p>

        <h2>Preserving our friends</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Sadly, whales face numerous threats in their natural habitat, including entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, pollution, and the impacts of climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these incredible creatures and their habitats. Marine protected areas, responsible whale-watching practices, and international agreements like the moratorium on commercial whaling are steps in the right direction.</p>   
            <p>Observing whales in their natural environment is a humbling experience that highlights the intricate balance of marine ecosystems and the importance of preserving these gentle giants. As ambassadors of the ocean, whales remind us of the wonders beneath the waves and our responsibility to safeguard their future.</p>

        <h2>Curiosities</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Migratory by nature, many whale species travel thousands of miles between feeding and breeding grounds. Humpback whales, for example, are known for their long migrations from the polar regions to warmer tropical waters where they give birth and nurse their young. These journeys are not just remarkable feats of endurance but also vital for the survival of their species, ensuring that their calves are born in safe, predator-free waters.</p>   
            <p>Whales communicate through a complex system of sounds, which can travel great distances underwater. These vocalizations are essential for navigation, finding mates, and coordinating feeding. The songs of the humpback whale are particularly famous, with their haunting melodies resonating through the ocean depths, sometimes lasting for hours.</p>
